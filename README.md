- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @noahscantron

- ðŸ‘€ Day to day I do data-science in Python, rock-climb (boulder), cook new recipes with my wife, play FPSs on my PC build, and explore swimming holes around Austin!

- ðŸ”¢ I'm searching for an exciting opportunity to help businesses understand their problems and solve them well with data. If you think I'd be a fit with your team, please reach out to me.
